Guideline adherent evidence-based physiotherapy

## Introduction

The "GAEP" application (Guideline Adherent Evidence Based Physiotherapy) is an innovative software solution specifically designed to support physiotherapists in the effective use of medical guidelines. Using OpenAI's advanced GPT models, GAEP is able to search and summarize content from different guidelines in a user-specific way. This is done via an interactive question-and-answer dialog system that directly references and succinctly reproduces relevant content from the guidelines.

GAEP is a valuable resource that aims to simplify and improve access to and application of evidence-based practice in physiotherapy, ultimately optimizing patient care.

The application was developed using the Mendix platform, among others, and is available as an open source prototype. The aim of this documentation is to provide a comprehensive overview of the structure and functionality of the application. This includes details on the architecture of the software, instructions for installation and setup as well as information on everyday use.

Although the application was developed in German and only German guidelines are used, we have decided to provide documentation in English.

## Target group

The "GAEP" application is primarily aimed at physiotherapists who wish to use evidence-based methods in their daily practice. Although medical guidelines in Germany are primarily designed for doctors and build an important bridge between science and clinical practice, physiotherapists can also benefit considerably from their content. Guidelines provide a structured framework for physiotherapy treatments and serve as a sound basis for argumentation in discussions with patients.

However, these guidelines are often written in complex technical language that can be difficult to understand without specific medical knowledge. This poses a particular challenge for professionals outside the medical profession. The GAEP application addresses this problem by reducing the complexity of the information and aggregating it in a way that is tailored to specific specialist questions. By using artificial intelligence, not only is the content of the guidelines precisely summarized, but the language is also simplified to a generally understandable level.

## System overview of the GAEP application

1. user interaction: web browser: The user interacts with the GAEP application via a web browser. This provides a user-friendly interface for accessing the application.
2. front end: GAEP APP (Mendix Server FreeTier): The front end of the application runs on a Mendix server in FreeTier mode. Mendix enables rapid development and deployment of web and mobile applications with little code effort. This is where the application processes user input and provides the user interface.
3. backend and data processing:
* FLASK Server (REST API): The Flask Server serves as the backend of the application and provides a REST API. Requests from the GAEP app are received and processed via this API. The Flask Server acts as an intermediary between the database and the application, as well as between the application and external AI services.
* Guideline Database: All relevant data and information from medical guidelines are stored here. The Flask Server accesses this database to answer specific queries or provide data for processing.
5. integration of artificial intelligence: GPT-4 (OpenAI API): The application uses GPT-4, an advanced paid model from OpenAI, to analyze and summarize the content of medical guidelines on a user-specific basis. The Flask server sends requests to the OpenAI API, receives responses and forwards them back to the frontend to be displayed to the user.

## Data flow
The data flow begins with the user, who sends requests to the GAEP APP via the web browser.
The GAEP APP forwards these requests to the Flask server, which in turn retrieves the necessary data from the Guideline Database or sends requests to the OpenAI API.
Responses from the OpenAI API are received and processed by the Flask Server before being sent back to the frontend to display the requested information to the user.

## Security and data protection

### Security measures
**Password encryption 
Communication with the Flask server is carried out using password encryption. This helps to ensure the security of the transmitted data.
Prototype status: The current development status of the GAEP application is defined as a prototype. Additional security measures should be considered before productive use.
**Suitability of the Flask server** 
The Flask Server used in its standard configuration is not intended for use in a production environment. For production use, more robust and security-oriented server solutions or additional security layers should be considered.

### Data protection
The protection and use of user data in the GAEP application is governed by the following measures:

**Data segregation** 
The architecture of the server that connects the Mendix app to the OpenAI API is designed in such a way that no user data is forwarded to OpenAI. This prevents sensitive or personal data from being inadvertently transferred to external services.
**Disclaimer
When accessing the application, users are informed that the processing of personal data with the application is not permitted.
**Restricted data protection measures** 
Apart from the above-mentioned data separation and the disclaimer, no other specific data protection measures have been implemented. Given the sensitivity of medical data, it is recommended to develop and implement additional data protection strategies, especially with regard to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other relevant data protection regulations.

### Recommendations for future developments
To improve the security and privacy of the GAEP application, the following measures should be considered:

**Implementation of additional security measures** 
These could include: Use of HTTPS to encrypt all data transmissions, more robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, and regular security audits.
**Adapting to production standards** 
Revision of the server configuration and possible migration to a platform that is better suited for production use.
**Data protection compliance** 
Further development of data protection practices to ensure that all personal data is handled in compliance with local and international data protection laws.

## Database structure
The GAEP application uses a structured SQL database to store and manage medical guidelines and related recommendations. The database schema, as shown in the diagram provided, contains multiple tables and relationships that allow for detailed and organized storage of data. As mentioned above the development happened in german language therefore some artifacts are still in german - like table and feature names. Here is a description of the main components of this schema:

**Table "Empfehlung" (engl. Recommendation)**
* ID: Unique identification number.
* Text: The full text of the recommendation.
* Grad: Indicates the grade of the recommendation.
* Basis: Basis or foundation of the guideline.
* Seite (engl. Page): The specific page in the document to which the information refers.
* Nummer (engl. Number): The number of the recommendation within the guideline.
* Oberthema (engl. Main topic): The main topic of the recommendation, e.g. drug intervention.
* Zwischenthema (engl. Intermediate topic): second topic level
* Unterhema (engl. Sub-topic): third topic level
* OT_Text, ZT_Text, UT_Text: Text sections for top topic, intermediate topic and subtopic.
* OT_Nummer, ZT_Nummer, UT_Nummer (engl. OT_Number, ZT_Number, UT_Number): Numerical identifiers for the topics.

The recommendation table links specific recommendations to the respective topics and provides both numerical and text-based descriptions.

**Table "Empfehlungsdetail" (engl. detail)**
* ID: Unique identification number.
* Leitlinie (engl. Guideline): Reference to the guideline to which the detail belongs.
* Position: The specific position of the detail within the guideline.
* Text: Detailed description of the recommendation detail.
* Bild (engl. Image): Images or graphical representations associated with the recommendation base64 coded.

The Recommendation Detail table stores detailed information on specific aspects of a recommendation and also contains visual materials to support the text-based content.

**Table "quelle" (engl. source)**
* ID: Unique identification number.
* Leitlinie (engl. Guideline): Reference to the guideline.
* Number: The number or identifier of the source within the guideline.
* Details: Textual or other details about the source.
* Link: A web link to the source.

The source table provides information that verifies the origin and basis of the information contained in the guidelines.

**Links between the tables**

The relationships between the tables are defined by foreign keys that allow integrated and consistent navigation through the data. This structure efficiently supports the retrieval of data based on thematic or content links and ensures data integrity across the entire schema.
